    Not all Services running a Kubernetes cluster are exposed externally.  However Services

    only exposed internally to a cluster with a *clusterIp* are accessible through an

    apiserver proxy.

    Users may use Proxy to **connect to Kubernetes Services in a cluster that are not

    **Note:** Services running a type LoadBalancer or type NodePort may be exposed externally and

    accessed without the need for a Proxy.

    To connect to a Service through a proxy the user must build the Proxy URL.  The Proxy URL format is:

    A common usecase is to connect to Services running as part of the cluster itself.  A user can print out these

    Services and their Proxy Urls with `kubectl cluster-info`.
