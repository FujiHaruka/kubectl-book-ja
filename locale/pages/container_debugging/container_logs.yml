    If a container is crash looping and you want to print its logs after it

    exits, use the `-p` flag to look at the **logs from containers that have

    exited**.  e.g. `kubectl logs -p -c ruby web-1`

    Print all logs from **all containers for a Workload** by passing the

    Workload label selector to the `-l` flag.  e.g. if your Workload

    label selector is `app=nginx` usie `-l "app=nginx"` to print logs

    for all the Pods from that Workload.
