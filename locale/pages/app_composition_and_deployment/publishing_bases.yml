    Users may want to run a common White Box Application without writing the Resource Config

    for the Application from scratch.  Instead they may want to consume ready-made Resource

    Config published specifically for the White Box Application, and add customizations for

    their specific needs.

    Uses may fork a White Box Base hosted on GitHub by forking the GitHub repo.  This allows the user

    complete control over changes to the Base.  Users should periodically pull changes from the

    upstream repo back into the fork to get bug fixes and optimizations.
