    It is often necessary for users to want to **modify arbitrary fields** from a Base, such

    as resource reservations for Pods, replicas on Deployments, etc.  Overlays and patches can

    be used by Variants to specify fields values which will override the Base field values.

    Arbitrary **fields may be added, changed, or deleted** by supplying *Overlays* against the

    Resources provided by the Base.  **Overlays are sparse Resource definitions** that

    allow arbitrary customizations to be performed without requiring a base to expose

    the customization as a template.

    Overlays require the *Group, Version, Kind* and *Name* of the Resource to be specified, as

    well as any fields that should be set on the base Resource.  Overlays are applied using

    *StrategicMergePatch*.

    **Use Case:** Different Environments (test, dev, staging, canary, prod) require fields such as

    replicas or resources to be overridden.

    Overlays use the same [merge semantics](../app_management/field_merge_semantics.md) as Applying Resource Config to cluster.  One difference

    is that there is no *Last Applied Resource Config* when merging overlays, so fields may only be deleted

    if they are explicitly set to nil.

    Arbitrary fields may be added, changed, or deleted by supplying *JSON Patches* against the

    JSON Patches are [RFC 6902](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) patches that are applied

    to resources.  Patches require the *Group, Version, Kind* and *Name* of the Resource to be

    specified in addition to the Patch.  Patches offer a number of powerful imperative operations

    for modifying the base Resources.
